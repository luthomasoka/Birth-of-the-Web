      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Raleway Semi-bold 600
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Raleway Semi-bold 600 font is a web friendly font and is also a type of font that
        feels familiar when viewing content on a digital device. According to 
        Google " it is manually hinted for clarity on desktop and mobile computing
        screens."
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Raleway
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Raleway font is a web friendly type of font and is reminiscent of 
        the monospace font which is one of the earliest type of fonts used 
        for webpages, thus it suits the purpose of this website.

        Tim Berners Lee is the famous name behind the early development of the web. This British scientist working for an                 organization that is based in Geneva Switzerland, and includes a community of about 17000 scientists from 100 different           countries, noticed a problem of how these scientists struggled to share their research amongst themselves. Tim sought to         use three latest technologies at the time to tackle this problem.
        <ul>
          <li>HTML: HyperText Markup Language.</li>
          <li>URI/URL: Uniform Resource Identifier. A website “address” that is used to identify each resource on the web.</li>
          <li>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for requests of data to be sent to and from resources across the web.</li> 
        </ul>
        <br>
        Tim drafted a proposal for the Hypertext project called the World Wide Web 
        and made two consecutive proposals to his superiors. Following the rejection 
        of the first in March 1989 the second finally got it’s approval the following 
        year in May 1990. Tim immediately then started working on the first web server 
        on an exclusive NeXT computer and the first web browser implementing his ideas 
        from the Hypertext project. The very first address to the first website was http://info.cern.ch/. 
        Tim wanted the web to have a global reach so he decided that the web would be 
        completely free, so that anyone in the world could develop their own website to 
        share information and more to any other person anywhere in the world. This is why 
        we have plenty of websites today.
        Tim left CERN for Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994 where he engaged 
        himself and a few others to establish a global community devoted to maintaining and 
        enhancing the open web standards. The W3C as it is commonly referred to today sought 
        to maintain the following standards;
        <br>
      <ul>
        <li>“Decentralisation: No permission is needed from a central authority to post anything on the web,
        there is no central controlling node, and so no single point of failure … and no “kill switch”! 
          This also implies freedom from indiscriminate censorship and surveillance.”</li>
        <li>“Non-discrimination: If I pay to connect to the internet with a certain quality of service, 
        and you pay to connect with that or a greater quality of service, then we can both communicate 
          at the same level. This principle of equity is also known as Net Neutrality.”</li>
        <li>“Bottom-up design: Instead of code being written and controlled by a small group of experts, 
          it was developed in full view of everyone, encouraging maximum participation and experimentation.”</li>
        <li>“Universality: For anyone to be able to publish anything on the web, all the computers involved have
        to speak the same languages to each other, no matter what different hardware people are using; where they live; 
          or what cultural and political beliefs they have. In this way, the web breaks down silos while still allowing diversity to flourish.”</li>
        <li>“Consensus: For universal standards to work, everyone had to agree to use them. Tim and others achieved 
          this consensus by giving everyone a say in creating the standards, through a transparent, participatory process at W3C.”</li>
      </ul>
        <p>The Consortium has a website that you may visit to learn more about its mission and other principles fundamental to              its operation. 
          The website address is https://www.w3.org/ . Additional topics you may expect to find on the site include 
          internationalization, web security, privacy, code of ethics and professional conduct.</p>

        In closing I would like to share an answer to a question asked by a youth online. The question was , “So do you think the         web has been a bad idea or a good one?”
        His answer: “Some people point out that the Web can be used for all the wrong things. For downloading pictures of                 horrible, gruesome, violent or obscene things, or ways of making bombs which terrorists could use.
        Other people say how their lives have been saved because they found out about the disease they had on the Web, and               figured out how to cure it.
        I think the main thing to remember is that any really powerful thing can be used for good or evil. Dynamite can be used           to build tunnels or to make missiles. Engines can be put in ambulances or tanks. Nuclear power can be used for bombs or           for electrical power.
        So what is made of the Web is up to us. You, me, and everyone else.
        Here is my hope.
        The Web is a tool for communicating.
        With the Web, you can find out what other people mean. You can find out where they are coming from.
        The Web can help people understand each other.
        Think about most of the bad things that have happened between people in your life. Maybe most of them come down to one           person not understanding another. Even wars.
        Let's use the web to create neat new exciting things.
        Let's use the Web to help people understand each other.”

        The Hypertext Markup Language was and still is a fundamental component to Websites.  HTML is comprised of many elements           that can be used to render unique content on a browser. Each Element ascribes to the "Box-model concept" which simply             means that each element is rendered as a rectangle on the web page. The rectangle consists of four layers; margin,               border, padding and the actual content layer which is what is visible to the viewer. The other three layers are abstract         however they play a key role in positioning and styling the rendered content.
      </p>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheet is developed using HTML and is solely responsible for the presentation of almost all websites. An           example of a presentation aspect of a web page would be background-color. A selector is used to reference the HTML element       in question then a property of either one of the four layers we have mentioned above is invoked to which a value is               assigned. As its name suggests this technology cascades the styling effect to all children elements.
