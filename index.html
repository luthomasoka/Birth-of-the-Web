          How it all began
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph-1">
          Tim Berners Lee is the famous name behind the early development of the web. This British scientist working for an organization that is based in Geneva Switzerland, and includes a community of about 17000 scientists from 100 different countries, noticed a problem of how these scientists struggled to share their research amongst themselves. Tim sought to use three latest technologies at the time to tackle this problem.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-1">
          <li>HTML: HyperText Markup Language.</li>
          <li>URI/URL: Uniform Resource Identifier. A website “address” that is used to identify each resource on the web</li>
          <li>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for requests of data to be sent to and from resources across the web.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="headline-2">
          Going World Wide
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph-2">
          Tim drafted a proposal for the Hypertext project called the World Wide Web and made two consecutive proposals to his superiors. Following the rejection of the first in March 1989 the second finally got it’s approval the following year in May 1990. Tim immediately then started working on the first web server on an exclusive NeXT computer and the first web browser implementing his ideas from the Hypertext project. The very first address to the first website was <a href="http://info.cern.ch/">info.cern.ch</a> . Tim wanted the web to have a global reach so he decided that the web would be completely free, so that anyone in the world could develop their own website to share information and more to any other person anywhere in the world. This is why we have plenty of websites today. Tim left CERN for Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994 where he engaged himself and a few others to establish a global community devoted to maintaining and enhancing the open web standards. The W3C as it is commonly referred to today sought to maintain the following standards;
        </p>
        <ul class="list-2">
          <li>Decentralisation: No permission is needed from a central authority to post anything on the web, there is no central controlling node, and so no single point of failure … and no “kill switch”! This also implies freedom from indiscriminate censorship and surveillance.</li>
          <li>Non-discrimination: If I pay to connect to the internet with a certain quality of service, and you pay to connect with that or a greater quality of service, then we can both communicate at the same level. This principle of equity is also known as Net Neutrality.</li>
          <li>Bottom-up design: Instead of code being written and controlled by a small group of experts, it was developed in full view of everyone, encouraging maximum participation and experimentation</li>
          <li>Universality: For anyone to be able to publish anything on the web, all the computers involved have to speak the same languages to each other, no matter what different hardware people are using; where they live; or what cultural and political beliefs they have. In this way, the web breaks down silos while still allowing diversity to flourish</li>
          <li>Consensus: For universal standards to work, everyone had to agree to use them. Tim and others achieved this consensus by giving everyone a say in creating the standards, through a transparent, participatory process at W3C.</li>
        </ul>
          <p class="paragraph-2-1">
            The Consortium has a website that you may visit to learn more about its mission and other principles fundamental to its operation. The website address is <a href="https://www.w3.org">www.w3.org</a> . Additional topics you may expect to find on the site include internationalization, web security, privacy, code of ethics and professional conduct.

            A mutual understanding
          </h2>
          <p class="paragraph-3">
            In closing I would like to share the answer to a question asked by a youth online. The question was, “So do you think the web has been a bad idea or a good one?” Tim's answer: “Some people point out that the Web can be used for all the wrong things. For downloading pictures of horrible, gruesome, violent or obscene things, or ways of making bombs which terrorists could use. Other people say how their lives have been saved because they found out about the disease they had on the Web, and figured out how to cure it. I think the main thing to remember is that any really powerful thing can be used for good or evil. Dynamite can be used to build tunnels or to make missiles. Engines can be put in ambulances or tanks. Nuclear power can be used for bombs or for electrical power. So what is made of the Web is up to us. You, me, and everyone else. Here is my hope. The Web is a tool for communicating. With the Web, you can find out what other people mean. You can find out where they are coming from. The Web can help people understand each other. Think about most of the bad things that have happened between people in your life. Maybe most of them come down to one person not understanding another. Even wars. Let's use the web to create neat new exciting things. Let's use the Web to help people understand each other.”
